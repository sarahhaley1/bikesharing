# New York City Bikesharing Visualizations

### Background
New York City has a popular bikesharing company that allows people aroung NYC to be able to rent bikes with a certain app and ride them while paying for their trip. This is a great idea for a big city like NYC, but how well would it survive in a smaller town with less tourism? 

### Purpose 
The idea of this analysis is a proposal for showing the different strategies that will be used when building a new bikesharing company in a smaller town that is less populated overall. There is an investor willing to hear the proposal and decide if he wants to supply funding. Using Tableau creating visualizations of the data which will be gathered from CitiBike will allow for projections to be better understood. The story that is told by the data through Tableau will be honest and will be used to show that a bikesharing comapny will survive given the right strategies. The interactive visualizations allow for finding trends within specfic parameters.
