# New York City Bikesharing Visualizations

### Background
New York City has a popular bikesharing company that allows people aroung NYC to be able to rent bikes with a certain app and ride them while paying for their trip. This is a great idea for a big city like NYC, but how well would it survive in a smaller town with less tourism? 

### Purpose 
The idea of this analysis is a proposal for showing the different strategies that will be used when building a new bikesharing company in a smaller town that is less populated overall. There is an investor willing to hear the proposal and decide if he wants to supply funding. Using Tableau creating visualizations of the data which will be gathered from CitiBike will allow for projections to be better understood. The story that is told by the data through Tableau will be honest and will be used to show that a bikesharing comapny will survive given the right strategies. The interactive visualizations allow for finding trends within specfic parameters.

### Results
  1. ![BikesPerHour](/images/BikesPerHour.png)
    - This visualization displays that the "rush hours" for the citiBikes are around 7am to around 9am and then again around 5pm to 7pm. 
    - The assumption can be made that there is a potential correlation between the fact that these are also typically commuting times for the start and end to the work day.
  
  2. ![ByGender](/images/ByGender.png)
    - This visualization allows us to see the same trend of the number of rides per hour, but with the added filter of gender. Thus this displays the different trends of usage of citiBikes, based on the registered gender on the account. 
    - What is shown is that the Male trend line is very similar to the overall trend, making it seem as though maybe the male population makes up most of the citibike users.
 
 3. ![ByWeekDay](/images/ByWeekDay.png)
 - This visualization allows us to see the usage of bikes based on the day of the week. Here we can see that it is more likely for the demand of bikes to be higher on the weekend and later in the week. 
    
  4. ![ByGenderHour](/images/ByGenderHour.png)
    - This heat map gives us the detail of the trending times for bikesharing in a more visually pleasing way. While we compare the number of rides with the day of the week we also the filter the data by gender of the user. This allows us to see the trends in a more easily udnerstood way and when the hot times are - when more bikes are being used.
  
  5. ![ByUser](/images/ByUser.png)
  - This heat map displays the bikes being used each day of the week with the filter of user type - Subscriber or Customer versus the gender of the user. The subscribers ride the bikes more often, and the most common gender is Male. There is a common use by the male gender of these bikes as a form of transportation. 
  
  6. ![ByHour](/images/ByHour.png)
  - This horizontal histogram shows the most common hours of usage - which is seen to be around 7am and 5pm. Therefore when deciding to dedicated certain hours for upkeep on the bikes, choosing a time that is not a surge for usage would be beneficial. Therefore - this data shows that the best time to delegate to repairs is between 1am and 5am. 
  
  7. ![StartingPointMap](/images/StartingPointMap.png)
  - The map of NYC and the markers of starting points with the size being based on numbers indicates the most common starting points are around Manhattan. 
  This could be due to the large tourism that NYC attracts, while also potentially being from the idea that the main office buildings are there. Either way, it makes sense due to the dense population that is in Manhattan. 

### Summary
The citiBike data gives a lot of information about NYC but it is hard to make assumptions based on how a small town would do with a bikesharing company. However, if a bikesharing company is put into action, using the above data, the best operation times are typically during rush hours and if you could target a certain demographic, it seems that men use these bikes more than others.
